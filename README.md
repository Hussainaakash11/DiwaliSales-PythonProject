# Diwali Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze Diwali sales data to identify trends, customer demographics, and purchasing behavior during the Diwali season. The analysis focuses on understanding the products that sold the most, customer preferences, and other insights that can help businesses optimize their marketing and inventory strategies for future Diwali seasons.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this analysis includes transaction details from Diwali sales. Key features include:

- **Age**: Age group of the customer.
- **Marital_Status**: Indicates whether the customer is married.
- **State**: State where the customer is located.
- **Category**: Product category (e.g., Food, Clothing, Electronics).
- **Orders**: Number of orders placed.
- **Amount**: Amount spent by the customer.

## Project Goals

- To identify the top-selling products during the Diwali season.
- To analyze customer demographics, such as age, gender, and marital status, and how they influence purchasing decisions.
- To understand the regional distribution of sales and product preferences.
- To provide actionable insights for businesses to improve their marketing strategies.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure consistency in the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various visualizations were created to explore the data and identify patterns.
   - Distribution of sales by gender and age group.
   - Analysis of marital status and its impact on purchasing behavior.
   - Regional analysis of sales across different states.
   - Identification of the top 10 most sold products.
3. **Conclusions**: Key findings and insights were summarized.
